    A man loses his identity while living under a repressive regime. In a story based on George Orwell's classic novel, Winston Smith (John Hurt) is a government employee whose job involves the rewriting of history in a manner that casts his fictional country's leaders in a charitable light. His trysts with Julia (Suzanna Hamilton) provide his only measure of enjoyment, but lawmakers frown on the relationship -- and in this closely monitored society, there is no escape from Big Brother.

    Winston Smith is a low-ranking member of the ruling Party in London, in the nation of Oceania.
    Everywhere Winston goes, even his own home, the Party watches him
    through telescreens; everywhere he looks he sees the face of the Party’s
    seemingly omniscient leader, a figure known only as Big Brother.
    The Party controls everything in Oceania, even the people’s history
    and language. Currently, the Party is forcing the implementation of an
    invented language called Newspeak, which attempts to prevent political
    rebellion by eliminating all words related to it. Even thinking rebellious thoughts is illegal.
    Such thoughtcrime is, in fact, the worst of all crimes.

    As the novel opens, Winston feels frustrated by the oppression and
    rigid control of the Party, which prohibits free thought, sex, and
    any expression of individuality. Winston dislikes the party and has
    illegally purchased a diary in which to write his criminal thoughts.
    He has also become fixated on a powerful Party member named O’Brien,
    whom Winston believes is a secret member of the Brotherhood—the
    mysterious, legendary group that works to overthrow the Party.
